Solar Energy, as one of the most environmental alternative sources in the nature, plays a significant role in humansâ€™ sustainable development. Even if experts have already developed some innovative ways to solve the current issues, such as high cost and low efficiency, engineers still need to be ready for the new challenges in developing solar energy. It is a duty for all engineers to make the world cleaner and better.
